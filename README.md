# 💧 FlowSence – Smart Groundwater Monitoring & Forecasting

![FlowSence Banner](assets/banner.png)

## 🚀 Problem Statement
India faces a **severe groundwater crisis** due to over-extraction, poor recharge monitoring, and lack of real-time insights.  
Current systems are **fragmented and reactive**, leading to unsustainable water management.

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters
- **5,260+ DWLR IoT stations** already deployed in India.  
- **85% of rural households** depend on groundwater for drinking & irrigation.  
- **245.64 BCM groundwater** extracted annually (~60% of total availability).  
- Punjab’s usage at **156.87%** → extreme overuse risk.
