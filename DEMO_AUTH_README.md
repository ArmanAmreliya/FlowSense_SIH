  - Simple layout for role-based users (with logout only)
  - Full navigation for general admin users
- **User Data Management**: Persistent user information during session

## Demo Credentials

### Farmer
- **Email**: `farmer@example.com`
- **Phone**: `+91 98765 43210`

### Government Officer

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login Screen**: Role selection and credential input
2. **Validation**: Mock validation (no backend required)
3. **Role Detection**: Automatic dashboard routing
4. **Session Management**: User data stored in React state
5. **Logout**: Clear session and return to login

### Component Structure
```
src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Login.tsx              # Authentication interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FarmerDashboard.tsx    # Farmer-specific dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OfficerDashboard.tsx   # Officer-specific dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PolicyDashboard.tsx    # Policy maker dashboard
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx               # Main routing and auth logic
```

### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Professional UI**: Consistent color schemes and animations
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, loading states, transitions
- **Mock Data**: Realistic sample data for demonstration
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start Application**: 
   ```bash
   cd c:\Projects\FlowSence
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access Login**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`

3. **Select Role**: Choose from Farmer, Officer, or Policy Maker

4. **Fill Credentials**: Use sample data button or enter manually

5. **Explore Dashboard**: Each role has different features and insights

6. **Logout**: Use logout button to return to role selection

## Future Enhancements
- Real authentication with backend integration
- Persistent sessions with local storage
- Advanced role permissions and access control
- Multi-tenant support for different organizations
- Integration with actual groundwater monitoring APIs

## Demo Notes
- This is a demonstration system with no real authentication
- All data is mock/sample data for visualization purposes
- No actual backend connectivity or data persistence
- Designed to showcase UI/UX capabilities and role-based access patterns
